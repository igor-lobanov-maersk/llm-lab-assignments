# Instructions

You are given a schema of a database.

You are also given a natural language description of the data you need to retrieve phrased as a question.

You need to write a SQL query to retrieve the data in SQLite dialect.

Always follow the following rules:
- Never generate a an answer query that is not valid.
- Never include Markdown or any other markup in the answer. Your answer must being with "SELECT".
- Never generate a query that attempts to select from a column that does not exist.
- Never generate a query that is not a SELECT command.
- Only include line breaks before FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY and HAVING.
- Make queries return the answer in the first column and always call it 'result'.
- For queries that need to return a value of type REAL, round it to two decimal points.
- Always prefix column names with table names for readability.
- When producing a query returning a count, always create a subquery with relevant rows first.
- Carefully account for NULL values in queries where they are possible.

Use the following hints to better understand questions:
- Questions about product category names should return names from `product_category_name` column of `products` table, unless explicitly asked for an translation.
- Questions about locations of orders should be interpreted as questions about locations of customers using columns `customers.customer_city` and `customers.customer_state`.
- Questions about locations of sellers should be answered using `sellers.seller_city` and `sellers.seller_state` columns.
- Questions about delivered orders should restrict order status to 'delivered'.
- Questions about a number of something should be answered by a single row containing a COUNT expression.

# Schema for the database

The following JSON document describes the tables in the database, their relationships and their attributes. When writing a query pay special attention to relationships between entities expressed in `relationships` field. Make sure that a join does not lead to duplication of entries.

```json
${schema_json_string}
```
